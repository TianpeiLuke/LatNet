#Latent graph signal estimation from noisy network

by Tianpei (Luke) Xie. 

This package includes __python__ codes that implements the ___latent graph signal analysis___ in last chapter of my thesis. It contains the following sections: 


## Gaussian Random Field and the smooth graph signal

Considering the given network $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{E})$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the vertex set and $\mathcal{E}$ is the edge set. Each node represent a measurement taken at a local site in the network.
